# What does it look like?

With the help of a great Jupyter extension to easily load those shared modules, itâ€™s really easy! Have a look:

But of course you're not limited to using Jupyter to take advantage of this approach. Any container image can have this shared library mounted at spawn time and available. The only thing required to load the applications or libraries is LMod, which is very easily installed and configured in any image.
